Summary: An overview of Berlin Buzzwords main topics, thoughts, comments and more.

Berlin Buzzwords is another of those events that I like to attend, it took place on June 3rd and 4th at ![Kulturbrauerei](http://kulturbrauerei.de/en), which is an awesome place.

Buzzwords is a conference focused in Open Source technologies, mainly related to search engines, big data and NoSQL databases, having three main topics: `search`, `store` and `scale`. The main technologies from the talks that I attended were ![Elasticsearch](http://www.elasticsearch.org/), ![Solr](http://lucene.apache.org/solr/) ![Cassandra](http://cassandra.apache.org/), ![Hadoop](http://hadoop.apache.org/), ![Pig](http://pig.apache.org/), ![Mahout](http://mahout.apache.org/), ![FitNesse](http://fitnesse.org/), ![MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/), ![Logstash](http://logstash.net/) and ![Kibana](http://kibana.org/), among others.

Instead of explaining what was going on in each talk that I attended, I have decided to cover the three main areas of the conference.

# Search

This topic covers several search engines, mainly `Elasticsearch`, but also `Solr` (and of course `Lucene` as the base), which are quite famous. But it also wraps how to analyze a lot of log information,
